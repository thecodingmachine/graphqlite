## 4.0

This is a complete refactoring from 3.x. While existing annotations are kept compatible, the internals have completely
changed.

New features:

- You can directly [annotate a PHP interface with `@Type` to make it a GraphQL interface](inheritance-interfaces.mdx#mapping-interfaces)
- You can autowire services in resolvers, thanks to the new `@Autowire` annotation
- Added [user input validation](validation.mdx) (using the Symfony Validator or the Laravel validator or a custom `@Assertion` annotation
- Improved security handling:
  - Unauthorized access to fields can now generate GraphQL errors (rather that schema errors in GraphQLite v3)
  - Added fine-grained security using the `@Security` annotation. A field can now be [marked accessible or not depending on the context](fine-grained-security.mdx).
    For instance, you can restrict access to the field "viewsCount" of the type `BlogPost` only for post that the current user wrote.
  - You can now inject the current logged user in any query / mutation / field using the `@InjectUser` annotation
- Performance:
  - You can inject the [Webonyx query plan in a parameter from a resolver](query_plan.mdx)
  - You can use the [dataloader pattern to improve performance drastically via the "prefetchMethod" attribute](prefetch_method.mdx)
- Customizable error handling has been added:
  - You can throw [GraphQL errors](error_handling.mdx) with `TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Exceptions\GraphQLException`
  - You can specify the HTTP response code to send with a given error, and the errors "extensions" section
  - You can throw [many errors in one exception](error_handling.mdx#many-errors-for-one-exception) with `TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Exceptions\GraphQLAggregateException`
- You can map [a given PHP class to several PHP input types](input-types#declaring-several-input-types-for-the-same-php-class) (a PHP class can have several `@Factory` annotations)
- You can force input types using `@UseInputType(for="$id", inputType="ID!")`
- You can extend an input types (just like you could extend an output type in v3) using [the new `@Decorate` annotation](extend_input_type.mdx)
- In a factory, you can [exclude some optional parameters from the GraphQL schema](input-types#ignoring-some-parameters)


Many extension points have been added

- Added a "root type mapper" (useful to map scalar types to PHP types or to add custom annotations related to resolvers)
- Added ["field middlewares"](field_middlewares.md) (useful to add middleware that modify the way GraphQL fields are handled)
- Added a ["parameter type mapper"](argument_resolving.md) (useful to add customize parameter resolution or add custom annotations related to parameters)

New framework specific features:

Symfony:

- The Symfony bundle now provides a "login" and a "logout" mutation (and also a "me" query)

Laravel:

- [Native integration with the Laravel paginator](laravel-package-advanced.mdx#support-for-pagination) has been added

Internals:

- The `FieldsBuilder` class has been split in many different services (`FieldsBuilder`, `TypeHandler`, and a
  chain of *root type mappers*)
- The `FieldsBuilderFactory` class has been completely removed.
- Overall, there is not much in common internally between 4.x and 3.x. 4.x is much more flexible with many more hook points
  than 3.x. Try it out!
