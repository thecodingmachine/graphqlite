## @Mutation annotation

The `@Mutation` annotation is used to declare a GraphQL mutation.

**Applies on**: controller methods.

Attribute      | Compulsory | Type | Definition
---------------|------------|------|--------

## @Field annotation

The `@Field` annotation is used to declare a GraphQL field.

Attribute      | Compulsory | Type | Definition

name           | *no*       | string | The name of the field. If skipped, the name of the method is used instead.
[outputType](type_mapping.mdx)     | *no*       | string | Forces the GraphQL output type of a query.

## @SourceField annotation

The `@SourceField` annotation is used to declare a GraphQL field.

**Applies on**: classes annotated with `@Type` or `@ExtendType`.

[outputType](type_mapping.mdx)     | *no*       | string | Forces the GraphQL output type of the field. Otherwise, return type is used.
logged         | *no*       | bool  | Whether the user must be logged or not to see the field.
right          | *no*       | Right annotation  | The right the user must have to see the field.
failWith          | *no*       | mixed  | A value to return if the user is not authorized to see the field. If not specified, the field will not be visible at all to the user.


## @Logged annotation
