GraphQLite is heavily relying on the concept of annotations (also called attributes in PHP 8+).

## Doctrine annotations

<div class="alert alert--warning">
    <strong>Deprecated!</strong> Doctrine annotations are deprecated in favor of native PHP 8 attributes. Support will be dropped in a future release.
</div>

Historically, attributes were not available in PHP and PHP developers had to "trick" PHP to get annotation support.  This was the purpose of the [doctrine/annotation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-annotations/en/latest/index.html) library.

Using Doctrine annotations, you write annotations in your docblocks:

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;

/**
 * @Type
 */
class MyType
{
}
```

Please note that:

- The annotation is added in a **docblock** (a comment starting with "`/**`")
- The `Type` part is actually a class. It must be declared in the `use` statements at the top of your file.


<div class="alert alert--info">
    <strong>Heads up!</strong>
    <p>Some IDEs provide support for Doctrine annotations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PhpStorm via the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7320-php-annotations">PHP Annotations Plugin</a></li>
        <li>Eclipse via the <a href="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/symfony-plugin">Symfony 2 Plugin</a></li>
        <li>Netbeans has native support</li>
    </ul>

    We strongly recommend using an IDE that has Doctrine annotations support.
</div>

## PHP 8 attributes

Starting with PHP 8, PHP got native annotations support. They are actually called "attributes" in the PHP world.

The same code can be written this way:

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;

#[Type]
class MyType
{
}
```

GraphQLite v4.1+ has support for PHP 8 attributes.

The Doctrine annotation class and the PHP 8 attribute class is **the same** (so you will be using the same `use` statement at the top of your file).

They support the same attributes too.

A few notable differences:

- PHP 8 attributes do not support nested attributes (unlike Doctrine annotations). This means there is no equivalent to the `annotations` attribute of `@MagicField` and `@SourceField`.
- PHP 8 attributes can be written at the parameter level. Any attribute targeting a "parameter" must be written at the parameter level.

Let's take an example with the [`#Autowire` attribute](autowiring.mdx):


```php
#[Field]
public function getProduct(#[Autowire] ProductRepository $productRepository) : Product {
    //...
}
```



## Migrating from Doctrine annotations to PHP 8 attributes

The good news is that you can easily migrate from Doctrine annotations to PHP 8 attributes using the amazing, [Rector library](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector).  To do so, you'll want to use the following rector configuration:

```php title="rector.php"
<?php

use Rector\Core\Configuration\Option;
use Rector\Php80\Rector\Class_\AnnotationToAttributeRector;
use Rector\Php80\ValueObject\AnnotationToAttribute;
use Rector\Set\ValueObject\SetList;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations as GraphQLite;

return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    // Here we can define, what sets of rules will be applied
    // tip: use "SetList" class to autocomplete sets
    // $containerConfigurator->import(SetList::CODE_QUALITY);

    // Set parameters
    $parameters = $containerConfigurator->parameters();
    $parameters->set(Option::PATHS, [
        __DIR__ . '/src',
        __DIR__ . '/tests',
    ]);

    $services = $containerConfigurator->services();

    // @Validate and @Assertion are part of other libraries, include if necessary
    $services->set(AnnotationToAttributeRector::class)
        ->configure([
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Query::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Mutation::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Type::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\ExtendType::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Input::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Field::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\SourceField::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\MagicField::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Logged::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Right::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\FailWith::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\HideIfUnauthorized::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\InjectUser::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Security::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Factory::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\UseInputType::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Decorate::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\Autowire::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\HideParameter::class),
            new AnnotationToAttribute(GraphQLite\EnumType::class),
        ]);
};
```
