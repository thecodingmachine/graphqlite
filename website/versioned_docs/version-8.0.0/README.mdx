A PHP library that allows you to write your GraphQL queries in simple-to-write controllers.

## Features

* Create a complete GraphQL API by simply annotating your PHP classes
* Framework agnostic, but Symfony, Laravel and PSR-15 bindings available!
* Comes with batteries included: queries, mutations, subscriptions, mapping of arrays / iterators,
file uploads, security, validation, extendable types and more!

## Basic example

First, declare a query in your controller:

```php
class ProductController
{
    #[Query]
    public function product(string $id): Product
    {
        // Some code that looks for a product and returns it.
    }
}
```

Then, annotate the `Product` class to declare what fields are exposed to the GraphQL API:

```php
#[Type]
class Product
{
    #[Field]
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
    // ...
}
```

That's it, you're good to go! Query and enjoy!

```graphql
{
  product(id: 42) {
    name
  }
}
```
