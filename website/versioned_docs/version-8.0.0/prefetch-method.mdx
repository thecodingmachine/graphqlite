## The problem

GraphQL naive implementations often suffer from the "N+1" problem.

Consider a request where a user attached to a post must be returned:

```graphql
{
    posts {
        id
        user {
            id
        }
    }
}
```

A naive implementation will do this:

- 1 query to fetch the list of posts
- 1 query per post to fetch the user

Assuming we have "N" posts, we will make "N+1" queries.

There are several ways to fix this problem.
Assuming you are using a relational database, one solution is to try to look
ahead and perform only one query with a JOIN between "posts" and "users".
This method is described in the ["analyzing the query plan" documentation](query-plan.mdx).

But this can be difficult to implement. This is also only useful for relational databases. If your data comes from a
NoSQL database or from the cache, this will not help.

Instead, GraphQLite offers an easier to implement solution: the ability to fetch all fields from a given type at once.

## The "prefetch" method

```php
#[Type]
class PostType {
    /**
     * @param mixed $prefetchedUsers
     * @return User
     */
    #[Field]
    public function getUser(#[Prefetch("prefetchUsers")] $prefetchedUsers): User
    {
        // This method will receive the $prefetchedUsers as first argument. This is the return value of the "prefetchUsers" method below.
        // Using this prefetched list, it should be easy to map it to the post
    }

    /**
     * @param Post[] $posts
     * @return mixed
     */
    public static function prefetchUsers(iterable $posts)
    {
        // This function is called only once per GraphQL request
        // with the list of posts. You can fetch the list of users
        // associated with this posts in a single request,
        // for instance using a "IN" query in SQL or a multi-fetch
        // in your cache back-end.
    }
}
```

When a `#[Prefetch]` attribute is detected on a parameter of `#[Field]` attribute, the method is called automatically.
The prefetch callable must be one of the following:
  - a static method in the same class: `#[Prefetch('prefetchMethod')]`
  - a static method in a different class: `#[Prefetch([OtherClass::class, 'prefetchMethod')]`
  - a non-static method in a different class, resolvable through the container: `#[Prefetch([OtherService::class, 'prefetchMethod'])]`
The first argument of the method is always an array of instances of the main type. It can return absolutely anything (mixed).

## Input arguments

Field arguments can be set either on the `#[Field]` annotated method OR/AND on the prefetch methods.

For instance:

```php
#[Type]
class PostType {
    /**
     * @param mixed $prefetchedComments
     * @return Comment[]
     */
    #[Field]
    public function getComments(#[Prefetch("prefetchComments")] $prefetchedComments): array
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * @param Post[] $posts
     * @return mixed
     */
    public static function prefetchComments(iterable $posts, bool $hideSpam, int $filterByScore)
    {
        // Parameters passed after the first parameter (hideSpam, filterByScore...) are automatically exposed
        // as GraphQL arguments for the "comments" field.
    }
}
```
