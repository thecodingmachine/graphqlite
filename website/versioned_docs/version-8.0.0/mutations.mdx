In GraphQLite, mutations are created [like queries](queries.mdx).

To create a mutation, you must annotate a method in a controller with the `#[Mutation]` attribute.

For instance:

```php
namespace App\Controller;

use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Mutation;

class ProductController
{
    #[Mutation]
    public function saveProduct(int $id, string $name, ?float $price = null): Product
    {
        // Some code that saves a product.
    }
}
```
