In some cases, you cannot or do not want to put an attribute on a domain class.

For instance:

* The class you want to annotate is part of a third party library and you cannot modify it
* You are doing domain-driven design and don't want to clutter your domain object with attributes from the view layer
* etc.

## `#[Type]` attribute with the `class` attribute

GraphQLite allows you to use a *proxy* class thanks to the `#[Type]` attribute with the `class` attribute:

```php
namespace App\Types;

use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Field;
use App\Entities\Product;

#[Type(class: Product::class)]
class ProductType
{
    #[Field]
    public function getId(Product $product): string
    {
        return $product->getId();
    }
}
```

The `ProductType` class must be in the *types* namespace. You configured this namespace when you installed GraphQLite.

The `ProductType` class is actually a **service**. You can therefore inject dependencies in it.

<div class="alert alert--warning"><strong>Heads up!</strong> The <code>ProductType</code> class must exist in the container of your application and the container identifier MUST be the fully qualified class name.<br/><br/>
If you are using the Symfony bundle (or a framework with autowiring like Laravel), this
is usually not an issue as the container will automatically create the controller entry if you do not explicitly
declare it.</div>

In methods with a `#[Field]` attribute, the first parameter is the *resolved object* we are working on. Any additional parameters are used as arguments.

## `#[SourceField]` attribute

If you don't want to rewrite all *getters* of your base class, you may use the `#[SourceField]` attribute:

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\SourceField;
use App\Entities\Product;

#[Type(class: Product::class)]
#[SourceField(name: "name")]
#[SourceField(name: "price")]
class ProductType
{
}
```

By doing so, you let GraphQLite know that the type exposes the `getName` method of the underlying `Product` object.

Internally, GraphQLite will look for methods named `name()`, `getName()` and `isName()`).
You can set different name to look for with `sourceName` attribute.

## `#[MagicField]` attribute

If your object has no getters, but instead uses magic properties (using the magic `__get` method), you should use the `#[MagicField]` attribute:

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\SourceField;
use App\Entities\Product;

#[Type]
#[MagicField(name: "name", outputType: "String!")]
#[MagicField(name: "price", outputType: "Float")]
class ProductType
{
    public function __get(string $property) {
        // return some magic property
    }
}
```

By doing so, you let GraphQLite know that the type exposes "name" and the "price" magic properties of the underlying `Product` object.
You can set different name to look for with `sourceName` attribute.

This is particularly useful in frameworks like Laravel, where Eloquent is making a very wide use of such properties.

Please note that GraphQLite has no way to know the type of a magic property. Therefore, you have specify the GraphQL type
of each property manually.

### Authentication and authorization

You may also check for logged users or users with a specific right using the "annotations" argument.

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Type;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\SourceField;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Logged;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\Right;
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Annotations\FailWith;
use App\Entities\Product;

#[Type(class: Product::class)]
#[SourceField(name: "name")]
#[SourceField(name: "price", annotations: [new Logged(), new Right("CAN_ACCESS_Price"), new FailWith(null)])]
class ProductType extends AbstractAnnotatedObjectType
{
}
```

Any attributes described in the [Authentication and authorization page](authentication-authorization.mdx), or any attribute this is actually a ["field middleware"](field-middlewares.md) can be used in the `#[SourceField]` "annotations" argument.

## Declaring fields dynamically (without attributes)

In some very particular cases, you might not know exactly the list of `#[SourceField]` attributes at development time.
If you need to decide the list of `#[SourceField]` at runtime, you can implement the `FromSourceFieldsInterface`:

```php
use TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\FromSourceFieldsInterface;

#[Type(class: Product::class)]
class ProductType implements FromSourceFieldsInterface
{
    /**
     * Dynamically returns the array of source fields
     * to be fetched from the original object.
     *
     * @return SourceFieldInterface[]
     */
    public function getSourceFields(): array
    {
        // You may want to enable fields conditionally based on feature flags...
        if (ENABLE_STATUS_GLOBALLY) {
            return [
                new SourceField(['name'=>'status', 'annotations'=>[new Logged()]]),
            ];
        } else {
            return [];
        }
    }
}
```
