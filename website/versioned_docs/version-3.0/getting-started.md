GraphQLite is a framework agnostic library. You can use it in any PHP project as long as you know how to
inject services in your favorite framework's container.

Currently, we provide bundle/packages to help you get started with Symfony, Laravel and any framework compatible
with container-interop/service-provider.

- [Get started with Symfony](symfony-bundle.md)
- [Get started with Laravel](laravel-package.md)
- [Get started with a framework compatible with container-interop/service-provider](universal_service_providers.md)
- [Get started with another framework (or no framework)](other_frameworks.md)
