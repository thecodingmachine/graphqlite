# GraphQLite Website

The GraphQLite website is primarily a documentation site for GraphQLite.  It's built on the Docusaurus framework, and is hosted on [GitHub](https://graphqlite.thecodingmachine.io/).

More details on using Docusaurus can be found in the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction).

*This documentation could use further updating.*

## Developing and Testing

All code changes, aside from errors in previous documentation, should be done in the `docs` directory.  The `package.json` file outlines available commands you can use for starting the server, building the docs, etc.

- `npm run build`  *(Transpiles/builds `docs` into `build` directory)*
- `npm run start`  *(Starts the local npm server)*

## Versioning

Firstly, doc versions are cached in the `versioned_docs` directory.  Meanwhile, the "Next" version, as represented on the website, is the current `master` branch of the `docs` dir.  A list of the versions available is actually managed by the `versions.json` file, regardless of the `versioned_docs` directory.

The [versioning section of the Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning) covers this is more detail, but the following is related to our specific implementation:

### Steps to Create and Deploy a new Version

*All command paths are relative to the `website` directory.  Ensure that you have `./node_modules/.bin` added to your path.*

1. Firstly, we need to tag a new version, which will cache a copy of the documentation in the `versioned_docs` directory, update the `versioned_sidebars`, and update the `versions.json` file.

    ```bash
    $ docusaurus docs:version 1.1
    ```
    *Be sure to include the X.X in the version, not just X.*
2. Technically, you're done, just commit these changes and the CI workflow will deploy when merged into `master`.
